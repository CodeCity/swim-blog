## Understanding the Role of Stroke and Turn Judges

Swimming competitions rely on the expertise of swim officials to ensure fair play and uphold the integrity of the sport. The officials that are focusing on the swimming are in the Judge of Strokes and the Inspector of Turns positions, and they play a critical role in enforcing the rules and regulations at a swim meet.

The Judge of Strokes and the Inspector of Turns are responsible for observing a swimmer or swimmers during a race, commonly referred to as a heat. Strokes and Turns focus on the swimmer and ensure they are using the proper technique and they are not committing any infractions. They must have a clear understanding of the specific regulations and rules governing each stroke, including the breaststroke. By closely monitoring the swimmers, the Stroke and Turns officials can review the start, stroke, turn, and finish of each swimmer. When a swimmer commits an infraction, the official will report the infraction to the Referee.  

Ensuring all swimmers use the proper technique is crucial in maintaining a level playing field and ensuring that all competitors adhere to the same set of rules. It is essential for stroke and turn judges to approach their decision-making with fairness, consistency, objectivity and impartiality, making judgments solely based on the evidence they observe during the race.

### Understanding the Decision-Making Philosophy

When making judgments, stroke and turn judges also follow a clear decision-making philosophy. They prioritize the principle of "benefit of the doubt." This means that if there is a reasonable doubt about a swimmer's violation, the judge will give the benefit to the swimmer and not penalize them. This philosophy helps foster a positive and supportive environment for swimmers, where they can focus on their performance and strive for their best results.

As an example, a swimmer may aggressively swim toward the wall before engaging in their turn. Depending on where the hands are placed, the touch of the wall may be slightly obscured from the splash the swimmer creates. Since the Inspector of Turns cannot clearly see if there was a simultaneous, two-handed touch, the office gives the benefit of the doubt to the swimmer and they not report an infraction.  

Objectivity and fairness are paramount. The swim officials experti6se, fairness, and decision-making philosophy contribute to the integrity of swimming competitions, ensuring a level playing field for all participants.

## Guidelines for Judging Breaststroke Technique

In order to accurately judge the breaststroke technique in competitive swimming, it is important to focus on key elements such as the start, the breaststroke kick, the two-handed simultaneous touch, and the proper touch of the wall. By understanding and applying these guidelines, judges can effectively assess the legality and performance of breaststroke swimmers.

The breaststroke has a dive start, and the swimmer can do one pull down with both arms, and then do one butterfly kick. The swimmer will need to surface soon as the head must break the surface when the arms get to the widest portion of the second stroke. The head must surface every stroke until the finish. 

The breaststroke kick is one of the defining characteristics of this stroke. It involves an alternating motion of the legs, with the feet turning outwards and the legs moving in a simultaneous frog-like motion. It is crucial for judges to observe the timing and execution of the kick, ensuring that both legs move together and that the toes are pointed out throughout the entire movement.

One additional item the swim official has to consider is the he two-handed simultaneous touch. According to the rules, swimmers must **touch the wall** with both hands simultaneously at the turns and at the finish. Judges should pay close attention to this action, ensuring that the touch is indeed simultaneous and that both hands make contact with the wall. 

Older swimmers will try to make the touch as efficient as possible, so they will touch with one hand and "swipe" with the other. This can be tricky for a swim official to observe so positioning of or the official is key. The swim official needs to be in a position where they can clearly see the touch. 

Any infraction that is seen by the swim official needs to be reported to the referee. The most common mistake made by the majority of swimmers is the non-simultaneous two-handed touch, however, the swim official needs to pay attention throughout the entire race as other infractions may occur. Once the infraction has been reported to the referee, it may be deemed a disqualification. The swim official will write up the disqualification slip and resubmit it for the referee for approval.
